#  Two Exclamation Points or !!

Double not, how we can use this construction?

It's same `Boolean()` but short

And if you work with dynamic data, you saw this construction

>  if(items.length > 0 && items.length !== 0 && items !== undefined && items !== null)

This construction is very long, but if we use `!!`

> if(!!items.lenght)
